# Create a DHRIFT Institute Landing Page

DHRIFT is predicated on the idea that learning is a means of building communities of practice and that learning communities are best positioned to determine what to focus on and how to organize their own learning events. As a result, we have created a workflow for taking the content available through DHRIFT Core's directory of workshops and to create a landing page that draws from that content and allows for customization. 

## What is a DHRIFT Institute Landing Page

A DHRIFT Institute Landing Page is a static webpage that can be hosted for free on GitHub pages. When creating your own series of workshops, digital institute, or even a course, you may want to pick and choose which workshops you would like to include. A DHRIFT Institute Landing Page assembles important information about your event combines it with a list of DHRIFT workshops of your choosing, and generates a static web page for participants to use. See our [GC Digital Research Institute](https://app.dhrift.org/inst/?instUser=GC-DRI&instRepo=GCDRI24Schedule)) for an example. 

## Requirements to Create a DHRIFT Landing Page

DHRIFT's Institute Landing Page requires that you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account set up in order to generate the site and to post it on GitHub pages.

## About the DHRIFT Wizard

### Overview
To make the site creation process easeier, the DHRIFT Wizard will walk users through the step-by-step process of creating a new DHRIFT Institute Landing Page. The wizard will ask for core information about your institute. Then you will click on a "Create Site" button. The Wizard will take the information you have input, combine it with the workshops and features of the DHRIFT App, and then store a new repository in your GitHub account. When your Landing Page is complete, navigate to http://dhrift.<youruserid>.github.io and see what you've created. 

Begin using the DHRIFT Wizard at [https://app.dhrift.org/wizard](https://app.dhrift.org/wizard). 

### How the DHRIFT Wizard Works
The DHRIFT Wizard is an application that collects information that you in put into each field. When you click "Create Institute," the application assembles all of the information and stores it in a file. DHRIFT takes 

### Accessing the DHRIFT Wizard

From the dhrift.org landing page, click the "Grow" link, or use this URL: [https://dhrift.org/create](https://dhrift.org/create). 

## Getting Started

Go to [https://dhrift.org/create](https://dhrift.org/create) to access the DHRIFT Institute Landing Page Wizard.

The first page of the wizard will encourage you to assemble all of the information you need before getting started. That information may include the following: 

- A title, description, format, location, and contact information for your event
- Dates, times, titles, DHRIFT workshops, resources, names and contact names of instructors, and any details participants should know.
- Any social media, sponsors, logos, and/or a replacement hero image you may want to use in place of our defaults
- Your GitHub credentials.

### TIP
Currently, DHRIFT cannot store information about your institute in the browser and it is unable to read from files already in your repository. As a result, creating an institute automatically overwrites the previous institute information. Admittedly, this is not ideal and is a known bug. Our recommendation in the meantime is to create a folder or file that contains all of the information you are about to input into the Wizard. Use that file to copy and paste the data into the wizard. Doing so will mean that your changes are not lost and that you can continue to make changes. We apologize for the inconvenience, but we are working to make this part of the process go more smoothly as part of ongoing development. 

## General Information

The DHRIFT Wizard will ask first for information pertaining to the entire event or institute you are creating. This includes the following fields which are explained in detail: 

### The title 

The title in the General Information section of the DHRIFT Wizard refers to the title that will appear in the institute landing page hero slide at the top of the page. Since DHRIFT can be used for a variety of learning settings, this might be the name of the event (such as the GC Digital Research Institute) or the title of the course you are teaching.
