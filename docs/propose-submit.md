### The Peer Review Process

All workshops submitted to the DHRI Curriculum Team for review will undergo a peer review process to ensure that they meet our workshop development guidelines and pedagogical standards. The peer review process includes the following steps:

1. **Initial Review**: The DHRI Curriculum Team will review your workshop proposal or submission to ensure that it aligns with our guidelines and includes all necessary information.

2. **Peer Review**: Your workshop will be reviewed by members of the DHRI Curriculum Team and external reviewers with expertise in the workshop topic. Reviewers will provide feedback on the content, structure, and pedagogical approach of your workshop.

3. **Feedback and Revisions**: You will receive feedback on your workshop from the DHRI Curriculum Team and reviewers. You may be asked to make revisions to your workshop based on this feedback.

4. **Final Review**: Once your workshop has been revised, it will undergo a final review by the DHRI Curriculum Team to ensure that all feedback has been addressed and that the workshop meets our standards.

5. **Acceptance and Publication**: If your workshop is accepted, it will be added to the core curriculum and made available to the public. You will be credited as the workshop creator and will have the opportunity to contribute to future updates and revisions.

The peer review process is designed to ensure that all workshops in the DHRI core curriculum meet our high standards for quality, accessibility, and engagement. We appreciate your contributions to our community of practice and look forward to working with you to develop innovative and engaging workshops for digital humanities research and teaching.

### After Your Workshop is Published

Once your workshop has been accepted and published in the core curriculum, it will be available to the public through the DHRI website and app. Participants will be able to access your workshop materials, resources, and activities, and engage with the content at their own pace.

As the workshop creator, you will have the opportunity to update and revise your workshop as needed, based on feedback from participants and the DHRI Curriculum Team. You can also contribute new workshops and resources to the core curriculum, expanding the range of topics and activities available to our community of learners.
