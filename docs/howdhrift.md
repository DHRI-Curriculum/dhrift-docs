How Does DHRIFT Work? 

DHRIFT is built on a few key technologies that make it easy to create, manage, and publish DH workshops. These technologies include:

- __GitHub:__ DHRIFT uses [GitHub](https://github.com/) to store and manage workshop content. Each workshop is stored in a GitHub repository, which contains the workshop’s markdown files, images, and other assets. GitHub also provides version control, so you can track changes to your workshop content over time.

- __Markdown:__ DHRIFT uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to write workshop content. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. It allows you to format text, add images, and create links without having to write HTML.

- __YAML:__ DHRIFT uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) to configure workshop metadata. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format that is easy to read and write. It allows you to specify metadata such as the workshop title, author, and description.

- __React:__ DHRIFT’s frontend is built with [React](https://react.dev/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows us to create interactive, responsive, and accessible interfaces for our workshops.

- __WebAssembly:__ DHRIFT uses [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) to run code snippets in the browser. WebAssembly is a low-level programming language that is designed to run fast and efficiently in web browsers. It allows us to incorporate code editors in a secure and sandboxed environment so that learners can immediately see the results of their code.

- __GitHub Actions:__ DHRIFT uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to automate the process of building and deploying workshop content. When you make changes to your workshop content, GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the changes to your DHRIFT site.
